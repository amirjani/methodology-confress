# Aspect Oriented Software Development 

* aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) is a software development technology that seeks new modularizations of software systems in order to isolate secondary or supporting functions from the main program's business logic

* AOSD allows multiple concerns to be expressed separately and automatically unified into working systems

<br>
in traditional way programmers needs to keep in mind following steps: 
    
1. things that need to be done
2. dealing with the issues 
3. the problems associated with the possible interactions
4. execution of the right behavior at the right time

and it may cause many serious problem for the product 

aspect oriented **main focus** is *identification*, *specification*, *representation* of **cross cutting concerns** and their modularization into separate functional units to work together.

> what is cross cutting concerns? 

are aspects of the program that affects other concerns

# History
Aspect oriented software development has many names so far like: 
- Subject Oriented Programming (Multidimensional Separation of Concerns)
- Feature Oriented Programming 
- Adaptive Programming 
- Aspect Oriented Programming(Gregor Kiczales)

He and Palo Alto Research Center later developed AspectJ framework which main concern is aop

<br><br>

## Aspect Oriented Programming led to: 
* development of a large class of **object-oriented development methodologies** 
* **methodologies** for dealing with aspects
* **modeling techniques** (often based on the ideas of the Unified Modeling Language, UML)
* **testing** technology for assessing the effectiveness of aspect approaches
<br><br>

## Aspect oriented software development refers to: 
* requirement engineering
* business process management
* analysis and design
* architecture
* programming and implementation techniques
* testing and software maintenance techniques.
